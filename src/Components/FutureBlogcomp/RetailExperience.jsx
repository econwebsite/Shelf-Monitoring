                            <h2>Optimizing Retail Shelf Management: The Role of Smart Cameras in Inventory and Compliance</h2>
                            <p>By Ranjith Kumar, Dec 02, 2024</p>

                            <div className="blogborder-box">

                             <p>In any retail store, ranging from mid-size to large-scale, the biggest challenge is maintaining the order of their shelves around the clock. The shelves in retail stores are packed with thousands of unique Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG).</p>   
                             <p>These CPGs must be arranged on the shelves in a way that will enhance the store’s merchandising, maximize sales, and make way for a seamless retail shopping experience for the customers. The shelf arrangements of products largely contribute to the revenue of retail stores. The right product placements influence customer’s buying habits. It is, therefore, important to have a continuous monitoring system that ensures shelf arrangement adheres to retail store compliance. </p>
                             <p>AI-powered shelf monitoring cameras come into the picture here. Cameras capable of carrying out data-driven realtime shelf monitoring by using machine-learning algorithms such as breed-based image recognition, etc., can be deployed for efficient shelf monitoring. These cameras can keep track of goods on the shelves based on the SKU of the products.</p>
                             <h3>What is SKU?  How Does It Help with Retail Store Shelf Management? </h3>
                             <p>In retail, SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit. It is a unique identifier used to track and manage product inventory. An SKU is assigned to every product, even for the slightest variation of the same product (such as size, color, or style). SKUs help us keep track of stock levels, which can be used for replenishments of the product when they go out-of-stock.</p>
                             <p>Shelf monitoring cameras can provide real-time data on shelf arrangements in retail stores based on SKUs. This can help us determine the On Shelf Availability (OSA) of goods, track misplaced products, get timely alerts for goods that are Out of Stock (OOS), maintain pricing compliance, and also determine if the arrangement of the shelves is adhering to Plan-O-Gram (POG) compliance.</p>
                             <p>In this blog, we will go into detail about customer/buyer pain points that shelf-monitoring cameras can address by using real-time data of product arrangement on retail store shelves.</p>
                             <h3>Key Customer Experience Pain Points Addressed Using Realtime Shelf Monitoring Cameras</h3>
                            <h3>1. Out of Stock / On-Shelf Availability (OOS & OSA)</h3>
                            <p>For retail operators, tracking out-of-stock (OOS) items and monitoring on-shelf availability (OSA) is important to ensure that products are always available, minimizing missed sales opportunities. Shelf cameras can be used to track product out-of-stock and on-shelf availability by continuously monitoring the shelves or taking images hourly and analyzing the acquired image data. The cameras need to be AI enabled with algorithms that can detect when products go low in stock or out of stock and alert stockers to restock shelves.</p>
                            <p>One method a camera can use to detect stock availability is depth-sensing. Through depth-sensing, cameras can detect if there are holes or empty spaces on the shelf; if there are, the cameras can scan barcodes on the shelves to see what SKU is out of stock. These tracking methods can help the store owners be prompt and do Just in Time (JIT) replenishments of the SKUs.</p>
                            <p>Cameras used for shelf monitoring should be equipped with advanced features, such as high-resolution capability for barcode scanning, price reading, and recognizing SKUs.</p>
                            <h3>2. Plan-O-Gram (POG) Compliance</h3>
                           <p>Plan-O-Grams are predefined arrangements for CPGs that retail stores should follow for increased sales or increment in Free Cash Flow (FCF). Plan-O-Grams are set based on consumer behaviors, demand forecasts, and product categories. Following POGs makes sure consumers have an easy shopping experience and that they are able to find the products easily. </p>
                           <p>Retail store shelves often go out of POG arrangement when customers constantly interact with shelves during shopping, which leads to misplacements of products. These need to be taken care of throughout the retail store's operating hours.</p>
                           <p>Planograms help arrange the products (or SKUs) in a way that similar products are placed near each other, or closely related brands are placed near each other, which is also called brand blocking. POGs also help in error-free demand forecasting of SKUs, calculating accurate Days on Hand (DOH – number of days until products need to be replenished again), etc.</p>
                           <p>Implementing and maintaining POGs at retail stores require highly advanced shelf monitoring camera systems backed by AI and ML algorithms. With shelf monitoring cameras, maintaining planograms at retail stores becomes more automated and requires less manual labor to make sure retail stores are complying with retail POG standards. For POG compliance, shelf monitoring cameras are required to have high-resolution imaging capabilities, wide Field of View (FOV) and coverage, real-time processing and connectivity, and consistent image quality in varied lighting.</p>
                            <h3>3. Price Compliance</h3>
                            <p>Shelf monitoring cameras help in maintaining price compliance in retail stores by automated price tag scanning and verification. These cameras use technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture price tags and product labels on SKUs. This acquired data can be compared against the store’s internal price database to verify that displayed prices are correct and that the SKUs are placed at their designated places.</p>
                            <p>Retail stores frequently update prices due to temporary price reductions (TPRs), promotions, seasonal discounts, or manufacturer price changes. Implementing these changes manually across thousands of products can lead to errors or delays. Shelf monitoring cameras can be integrated with the store’s pricing system to continuously monitor and detect any mismatches between digital price updates and physical price tags.</p>
                            <p>Cameras with higher resolution will feed high quality images with finer details to the AI model to carry out object detection and OCT to identify any missing or misplaced price tags, which can confuse customers and lead to lost sales or incorrect pricing at checkout. Additionally, modern retail stores are increasingly adopting Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) for dynamic pricing. Shelf monitoring cameras can be integrated with ESL systems to continuously check and validate the displayed digital prices.</p>
                             <h3>Why Retail Store Owners Should Choose Shelf Monitoring Cameras for Efficiency and Compliance?</h3>                    
                             <br></br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Reduced Costs</b><br/> Shelf monitoring cameras are the least expensive solution when compared to other retail store compliance technologies such as robots, drones, etc. The cameras are cost effective and require no maintenance for a prolonged period of up to 3 years. These shelf monitoring camera systems are also easy to install and integrate into stores and, therefore, result in no store downtime.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Scalable and Can be Installed Throughout the Store</b><br></br>Shelf cameras can be digitized for every part of the stores to detect ins and outs, low, POG compliance, messy shelves, etc.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Continuous Scanning and Monitoring</b><br></br>Shelf cameras can be configured to take images every minute if required. This can provide users with a continuous product timeline and allow them to analyze how shelves look over time.  </p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Increased Accuracy</b><br></br>Shelf cameras can be placed in a way that it gets a good vantage point. This enables it to be more accurate and provide detailed images for deep learning solutions. Shelf cameras can take images in pre-defined time periods, so we can get a product timeline and see what shelves look like over time.</p> </li>
                                <li><p><b>Eased Shopping Experience for Consumers</b><br></br>The customers won’t notice the shelf cameras as they are small and compact. Therefore, it doesn’t interfere with the customer’s shopping experience or obstruct any views. </p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Uptime</b><br></br>As all the cameras in a store work independently of each other, if one camera goes down, there won’t be a single point of failure. All the other cameras will work just fine. It is proved that shelf cameras' uptime measurements are higher than 99%.</p></li>
                            </ul>
