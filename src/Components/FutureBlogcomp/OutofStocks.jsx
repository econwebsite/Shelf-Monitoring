                                <br></br>
                                <p>Tracking the availability of retail goods and knowing when products go out-of-stock is critical in retail. On-Shelf Availability (OSA) is a metric that measures whether the right products are consistently on display or available in the store and Out-of-Stock (OOS) is used to measure when items are not available in the shelves. OOS situations can lead to missed sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and long-term losses for retailers. Tracking OSA and OOS data of SKUs in retail stores can be a cumbersome manual procedure if the right technology is not used. Recent studies show that retailers face up to 8-10% OOS instances, directly impacting revenue.</p>
                                <p>With advancements in smart technologies, OSA and OOS monitoring have become more efficient. Cameras designed for shelf monitoring are now making it easier for stores to stay ahead of stock-related challenges. These AI-driven cameras can now track OSA and OOS issues in retail stores and inventories, helping retailers save time and effort. </p>
                                <p>In this blog, we will explore how retail shelf monitoring cameras are utilized for OSA and OOS tracking and how it benefits the retail landscape.</p>
                                <h3>Why OSA/OOS Monitoring is Critical for Retailers</h3>
                                <p>Retail success relies majorly on the consistent availability of products for customers.
